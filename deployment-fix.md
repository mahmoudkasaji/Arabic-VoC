# Deployment Pipeline Fix for Arabic VoC Platform

## Root Cause Analysis

The deployment error "Build process failed due to missing Python executable in the cache build directory" occurs because:

1. **UV Cache Corruption**: UV package manager creates cached Python executables in `/home/runner/workspace/.cache/uv/builds-v0/` that don't exist in the deployment environment
2. **Missing Python Path**: The deployment environment expects a different Python executable path than what UV has cached
3. **Lock File Conflicts**: The `uv.lock` file references resolution markers that conflict with the deployment Python version

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Created deployment-specific files:
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11 for deployment
- `Procfile` - Defines deployment run command
- `deployment.toml` - Configures UV bypass settings
- `MANIFEST.in` - Ensures proper file inclusion
- `build.sh` - Custom build script that bypasses UV

### 2. Updated configuration files:
- Enhanced `pyproject.toml` with version constraints and package data
- Modified `replit.toml` to use custom build script and UV bypass environment variables

### 3. Environment Variables Set:
```bash
UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1          # Forces UV to use system Python
PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=1    # Prevents pip build isolation
PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1          # Disables pip caching
UV_CACHE_DIR=""             # Disables UV caching
UV_LINK_MODE=copy           # Forces UV to copy instead of link
```

## Deployment Command Fix

The deployment should now use the custom build script that:
1. Clears all UV cache directories
2. Temporarily disables `uv.lock`
3. Uses system Python directly with pip
4. Installs all dependencies bypassing UV entirely

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works, the deployment should:
1. Execute `./build.sh` during build phase
2. Use environment variables to bypass UV
3. Install packages with pip directly
4. Start the application with gunicorn

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these fixes, the deployment pipeline should:
- ✅ Bypass UV package manager entirely during deployment
- ✅ Use system Python executable successfully  
- ✅ Install all dependencies without cache conflicts
- ✅ Start the application on the correct port

The key insight is that this error occurs specifically in deployment environments where UV's cached Python executables are not available, and the solution is to bypass UV entirely for deployments while maintaining UV for development.
