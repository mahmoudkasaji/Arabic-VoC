## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the Arabic Voice of Customer Platform seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1. **Do not create public issues** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at security@arabicvoc.com
3. **Provide detailed information** including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation if known

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix implementation**: Within 7-14 days (depending on severity)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

### Security Measures in Place

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Database security**: Encrypted connections and access controls
- **API security**: JWT tokens with expiration and refresh mechanisms

#### Access Control
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Required for admin accounts
- **Role-based access control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session management**: Secure session handling with timeout
- **API rate limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of all inputs
- **SQL injection prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
- **XSS prevention**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF protection**: Token-based CSRF protection on all forms

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Security headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies
- **Container security**: Secure base images and minimal attack surface
- **Network security**: Firewall rules and VPN access for admin functions

### Compliance

The platform maintains compliance with:
- **GDPR**: European data protection regulations
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

- **Password policies**: Minimum complexity requirements

#### Database Security
- **Connection encryption**: All database connections encrypted
- **Access controls**: Database users with minimal required permissions
- **Query logging**: Sensitive operations logged for audit
- **Backup encryption**: All backups encrypted and tested

### Incident Response Plan

#### Detection
- **Automated monitoring**: Security events trigger alerts
- **Log analysis**: Regular review of security logs
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Weekly automated scans
- **Penetration testing**: Quarterly security assessments

#### Response
1. **Immediate containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Impact assessment**: Determine scope and severity
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders as appropriate
4. **Evidence preservation**: Maintain logs and artifacts
5. **Recovery**: Restore services securely
6. **Post-incident review**: Learn and improve processes

### Security Training

All team members receive training on:
- Secure coding practices
