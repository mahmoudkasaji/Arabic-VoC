# Multi-Channel Survey Delivery Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation extends the existing Arabic Voice of Customer platform to support proactive survey distribution across multiple channels while maintaining the current feedback submission capabilities as a demo feature.

## Architecture Overview

### Dual-Mode Operation
```
Current System (Maintained as Demo):
â”œâ”€â”€ Manual feedback submission forms
â”œâ”€â”€ Open-ended customer comments

â””â”€â”€ Real-time processing pipeline

New Survey System (Production Feature):
â”œâ”€â”€ Structured questionnaire distribution
â”œâ”€â”€ Scheduled campaign management
â”œâ”€â”€ Multi-channel delivery orchestration
â””â”€â”€ Advanced response analytics
```
