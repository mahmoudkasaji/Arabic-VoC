- Performance degradation detection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Analysis
```python
from utils.specialized_orchestrator import VoCAnalysisCommittee

committee = VoCAnalysisCommittee()
result = await committee.analyze_feedback_enhanced(
    text="الخدمة ممتازة والفريق محترم جداً ما شاء الله",
    use_consensus=True
)

# Results include consensus scoring and cultural intelligence
print(f"Consensus Score: {result['consensus_score']}")
print(f"Cultural Confidence: {result['cultural_confidence']}")
print(f"Sentiment (Adjusted): {result['sentiment']['adjusted_score']}")
```

### Prompt Optimization
```python
from utils.prompt_optimizer import PromptOptimizer

optimizer = PromptOptimizer()
compressed, metrics = optimizer.compress_prompt(
    original_prompt,
    compression_level="balanced"
)

print(f"Token Reduction: {metrics.compression_ratio:.2%}")
print(f"Estimated Cost Savings: ${original_cost - new_cost:.2f}")
```

### Cultural Context Analysis
```python
from utils.prompt_optimizer import CulturalContextManager

cultural_manager = CulturalContextManager()
analysis = cultural_manager.adjust_sentiment_for_culture(
    text="الحمد لله الخدمة زينة والله",
    base_sentiment=0.7,
    detected_dialect="gulf"
)

print(f"Cultural Features Detected: {len(analysis['cultural_features'])}")
print(f"Sentiment Adjustment: {analysis['sentiment_change']:+.2f}")
