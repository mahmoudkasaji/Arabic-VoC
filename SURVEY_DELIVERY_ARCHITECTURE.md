### 2. Intelligent Distribution Logic

#### Customer Preference Engine
```python
class CustomerPreferenceEngine:
    def determine_optimal_channel(customer_profile):
        # Analyze:
        # - Previous response rates by channel
        # - Time-of-day preferences  
        # - Language preferences
        # - Device usage patterns
        # - Demographic factors
        return optimal_channel, backup_channels
```

#### Multi-Channel Campaign Management
```python
class SurveyCampaign:
    channels: List[ChannelConfig]
    timing_strategy: TimingStrategy
    fallback_sequence: List[Channel]
    response_tracking: ResponseTracker
    
    def execute_campaign():
        # Primary channel attempt
        # Wait period for response
        # Fallback channel activation
        # Cross-channel deduplication
```

### 3. Survey Response Collection

#### Unified Response Processing
```python
class SurveyResponseProcessor:
    def process_response(response, channel, survey_id):
        # Channel-specific parsing
        # Arabic text normalization
        # Multi-agent analysis
        # Real-time analytics update
        # Response validation
        return processed_response
```

#### Channel-Agnostic Data Model
```python
class SurveyResponse:
    survey_id: str
    respondent_id: str
    channel: FeedbackChannel
    responses: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: ChannelMetadata
    completion_status: CompletionStatus
    language_detected: str
    submission_timestamp: datetime
```

### 4. Integration with Existing System

#### Dual-Mode Operation
```
Current: Feedback Submission (Demo/Production)
├── Manual feedback forms
├── Open-ended comments
├── Rating submissions
└── Real-time processing

New: Survey Distribution (Production)
├── Structured questionnaires
├── Scheduled campaigns
├── Targeted delivery
└── Response analytics
```

#### Shared Infrastructure
- Same database models with survey context
- Existing Arabic processing pipeline
- Current multi-agent analysis system
- Real-time dashboard integration
- Same security and rate limiting
