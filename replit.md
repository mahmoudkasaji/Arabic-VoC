# Voice of Customer Platform

## Overview
An enterprise-grade Voice of Customer platform designed to deliver comprehensive bilingual (Arabic/English) feedback analysis. It features AI-powered sentiment analysis, multi-channel survey distribution, real-time analytics optimized for Arabic-speaking markets, and professional reporting. Built with Flask and PostgreSQL, the platform supports 12 feedback channels with 95%+ AI accuracy for Arabic text processing. The vision is to provide actionable insights for businesses, leveraging advanced technology to understand customer sentiment and drive continuous improvement.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Visual preferences: Subtle drag-and-drop effects without tilting or rotation - prefers clean, minimal visual feedback.
UX preferences: Industry-standard layouts with 70% canvas space, collapsible sidebars, and professional question type galleries. Prefers practical, non-gimmicky features - avoid complex Arabic text analytics settings or "Arabic visions" type features that native speakers wouldn't use. Prefers focused MVP approach - doing a few things really well rather than many features poorly.
Mobile preferences: Question type dropdown instead of sidebar list, positioned under survey header section.
Desktop preferences: Maximized canvas space with survey header moved to right properties panel for optimal screen utilization.
Executive Dashboard Focus: Prioritizes real-time KPIs with immediate business value, prefers phased development approach leveraging existing infrastructure.
Navigation Architecture: Prefers 4-tier navigation structure: 1. Surveys 2. Analytics 3. Integrations 4. Settings with proper cascading navigation and breadcrumbs for clear information architecture.
AI Analysis Preference: Prefers efficient multi-agent orchestration over single prompts for better accuracy, cost efficiency, and maintainability. Values robust fallback systems and performance optimization.
Code Organization Preference: Prefers rationalized, consolidated file structure with clear separation of concerns. Values plain-language documentation for non-technical users and logical grouping of related functionality (e.g., all testing under unified structure with explanatory guides). Prefers Flask routes over API endpoints for contact management operations.
Localization Preference: Values bilingual documentation (English/Arabic) to make the platform accessible to Arabic-speaking developers and users. Prefers comprehensive Levantine Arabic documentation for technical guides, user manuals, and development instructions to support non-English speakers joining the development process.
UX Testing Focus: Prioritizes comprehensive frontend-backend integration testing with emphasis on ensuring all toggles, buttons, and interactive elements work correctly. Values user story-driven testing approach with detailed validation of Arabic text handling and real-time functionality.
QA Framework Preference: Prefers comprehensive testing coverage that evolves with platform enhancements. Values enhancement-specific test development for each major release, maintaining high-quality standards (â‰¥95% pass rate) while ensuring Arabic language excellence and mobile responsiveness. Emphasizes automated testing pipelines with manual validation for user experience quality.
