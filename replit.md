# Arabic Voice of Customer Platform

## Overview

An Arabic-first multi-channel feedback processing platform built with Flask and SQLAlchemy. The system collects customer feedback from various channels (email, phone, website, social media, etc.), processes Arabic text using AI-powered analysis, and provides real-time analytics and insights.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask with WSGI support (switched from FastAPI for Replit compatibility)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy (SQLite for development)
- **ORM**: Flask-SQLAlchemy with sync sessions
- **Language Processing**: Custom Arabic text processor with reshaping and normalization
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for sentiment analysis and text processing
- **Server**: Gunicorn with sync workers (optimized for Replit environment)
- **Environments**: Multi-environment support (development/test/staging/production)

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Jinja2 with RTL (Right-to-Left) support
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Arabic design system
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with Arabic locale support
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Fonts**: Arabic fonts (Amiri, Cairo) with Font Awesome icons

### Database Design
- **Feedback Model**: Stores original and processed Arabic text with metadata
- **Analytics Model**: Pre-computed aggregations for performance optimization
- **Channels**: Support for 10+ feedback channels (email, WhatsApp, social media, etc.)
- **Status Tracking**: Processing pipeline from pending to processed

## Key Components
