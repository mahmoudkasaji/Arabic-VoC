# How to Run Tests - Step by Step Guide

## For Non-Technical Users

### Using the Web Interface (Easiest)
1. **Access the Test Dashboard**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to the platform's admin section
   - Click on "System Health" or "Quality Checks"

2. **View Current Status**
   - Green indicators = Everything working well
   - Yellow indicators = Minor issues being addressed
   - Red indicators = Problems that need attention

3. **Get Detailed Reports**
   - Click "Download Test Report" for a summary
   - Reports are generated in plain English
   - Share reports with technical team if needed

### Requesting Test Runs
If you need fresh test results:
1. Contact your system administrator
2. Request a "full system test"
3. Results usually available within 30 minutes

## For Technical Users

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have the required environment
cd /path/to/arabic-voc-platform
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Test Commands

#### Run All Tests (Complete Health Check)
```bash
# Full test suite - takes about 10 minutes
python -m pytest testing/ -v

# With coverage report
python -m pytest testing/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

#### Run Specific Test Categories

##### Arabic Analysis Tests
```bash
# Test Arabic text processing and AI analysis
python -m pytest testing/unit/test_arabic_analysis.py -v
python -m pytest testing/integration/test_agent_orchestration.py -v
```

##### Performance Tests
```bash
# Test system speed and efficiency
python -m pytest testing/performance/ -v
```

##### User Experience Tests
```bash
# Test complete user workflows
python -m pytest testing/user_experience/ -v
```

##### Security Tests
```bash
# Test data protection and access control
python -m pytest testing/security/ -v
```

### Advanced Testing Options

#### Run Tests with Different Verbosity
```bash
# Minimal output (just pass/fail)
python -m pytest testing/ -q

# Detailed output (shows each test)
python -m pytest testing/ -v

# Very detailed (shows all assertions)
python -m pytest testing/ -vv
```

#### Run Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Benchmark Arabic analysis speed
python -m pytest testing/performance/test_agent_performance.py::TestAgentPerformance::test_agent_vs_legacy_speed -v

# Benchmark dashboard loading
python -m pytest testing/performance/test_dashboard_speed.py -v
```

#### Run Security Validation
```bash
# Check authentication security
python -m pytest testing/security/test_authentication.py -v

# Validate data protection
python -m pytest testing/security/test_data_protection.py -v
```

### Interpreting Test Output

#### Successful Test Example
```
testing/unit/test_arabic_analysis.py::test_sentiment_detection PASSED [90%]
testing/unit/test_arabic_analysis.py::test_dialect_recognition PASSED [100%]

========================= 2 passed in 1.23s =========================
```
**Translation**: Both Arabic analysis tests passed successfully in about 1 second.

#### Failed Test Example
```
testing/performance/test_dashboard_speed.py::test_load_time FAILED [50%]

FAILURES:
test_load_time - AssertionError: Dashboard loaded in 3.2s, expected <2s
```
**Translation**: Dashboard is loading slower than the 2-second target.

#### Test Summary
```
========================= test session starts =========================
collected 154 items

testing/unit/..........................................  [ 28%]
testing/integration/...................................  [ 52%] 
testing/performance/....................F..............  [ 74%]
testing/user_experience/............................... [ 89%]
testing/security/........                               [100%]

=================== 146 passed, 8 failed in 124.32s ===================
```
**Translation**: 146 out of 154 tests passed (95% success rate) in about 2 minutes.

### Continuous Testing (Automated)

#### Setting Up Automated Tests
```bash
# Run tests every time code changes
python scripts/setup_continuous_testing.py

# Schedule daily full test runs
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && python -m pytest testing/ --html=reports/daily_report.html
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Test Environment Issues
```bash
# If tests fail due to missing dependencies
pip install -r testing/requirements.txt

# If database tests fail
python scripts/reset_test_database.py

# If API tests fail
python scripts/check_test_server.py
```

#### Performance Test Issues
```bash
# If performance tests are too slow
python -m pytest testing/performance/ --timeout=300

# If memory issues occur
python -m pytest testing/performance/ --maxfail=1
```

#### Arabic Text Test Issues
```bash
# If Arabic text appears broken in test output
export LANG=ar_SA.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=ar_SA.UTF-8

# Re-run Arabic-specific tests
python -m pytest testing/unit/test_arabic_analysis.py -v
```

### Generating Reports

#### HTML Report (Visual)
```bash
python -m pytest testing/ --html=reports/test_report.html --self-contained-html
```
Creates a beautiful web page with test results and graphs.

#### JSON Report (Data)
```bash
python -m pytest testing/ --json-report --json-report-file=reports/test_data.json
```
Creates machine-readable data for further analysis.

#### Coverage Report
```bash
python -m pytest testing/ --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```
Shows which parts of the code are tested and which need more testing.

### Best Practices

#### When to Run Tests
- **Before deploying**: Always run full test suite
- **After code changes**: Run related test categories
- **Weekly**: Run complete performance and security tests
- **Before important demos**: Run user experience tests

#### Reading Test Results
- **Focus on categories relevant to your work**
- **Pay attention to performance trends**
- **Report any consistent failures immediately**
- **Celebrate improvements in test metrics**

### Emergency Procedures

#### If Many Tests Fail Suddenly
1. Check if test environment is properly set up
2. Verify database is accessible
3. Confirm external services (OpenAI API) are working
4. Check recent code changes for obvious issues
5. Contact development team with error logs

#### If Critical Security Tests Fail
1. **Stop deployment immediately**
2. Notify security team
3. Run security tests in isolation to confirm issue
4. Document and escalate to management if confirmed

## Test Schedule

### Daily (Automated)
- Basic functionality tests
- Arabic text processing validation
- Performance monitoring

### Weekly (Manual)
- Complete test suite
- Security penetration testing
- User acceptance testing

### Monthly (Comprehensive)
- Full performance benchmarking
- Load testing with maximum expected users
- Complete security audit
- Documentation review and updates

Remember: Testing is your safety net. Regular testing means fewer surprises and more confidence in the platform's reliability!
