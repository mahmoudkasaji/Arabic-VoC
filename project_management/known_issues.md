## Limitations and Constraints

### Arabic Language Processing

#### Dialect Coverage
- **Current Support**: Major dialects (Gulf, Egyptian, Levantine, Moroccan)
- **Limited Support**: Iraqi, Sudanese, Yemeni dialects
- **Not Supported**: Very local or tribal dialects
- **Roadmap**: Expanding dialect support in v1.1

#### Cultural Context
- **Strong Coverage**: Religious expressions, common courtesy phrases
- **Moderate Coverage**: Business and professional terminology
- **Limited Coverage**: Very specific cultural references or slang
- **Improvement Plan**: Continuous training data expansion

### Technical Limitations

#### Concurrent Processing
- **Current Capacity**: 100 concurrent users tested
- **Recommended Max**: 50 concurrent users for optimal performance
- **Scaling Plan**: Horizontal scaling and load balancing in v1.1

#### Data Retention
- **Current Limit**: Unlimited storage (PostgreSQL)
- **Performance Impact**: Query performance degrades after 1M+ feedback items
- **Mitigation**: Archiving strategy for old data planned

### Compliance and Security

#### Data Residency
- **Current Setup**: Data stored in deployment region
- **Limitation**: No multi-region data residency options yet
- **Compliance**: Meets GDPR requirements for EU data
- **Roadmap**: Multi-region deployment in v2.0

#### Audit Logging
- **Current Level**: Application-level audit trails
- **Missing**: Database-level change tracking
- **Impact**: Limited forensic capabilities
- **Plan**: Enhanced audit logging in v1.1
