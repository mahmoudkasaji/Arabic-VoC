# Replit Workflow Integration Guide

## Current Workflow System

Since direct `.replit` file modification is restricted, I've created a unified workflow management system that provides easy access to all DevOps operations.

## One-Command Workflow Access

### Primary Command
```bash
python workflow.py <operation>
```

### Available Operations

| Command | Purpose | What It Does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `python workflow.py status` | Environment Status | Shows all environment health and database stats |
| `python workflow.py test` | Run Tests | Comprehensive test suite with clean database |
| `python workflow.py staging` | Deploy Staging | Full staging deployment on port 5001 |
| `python workflow.py seed` | Add Test Data | Seeds development database with Arabic samples |
| `python workflow.py deploy` | Quick Deploy | Tests + staging deployment in one command |
| `python workflow.py health` | Health Check | Quick development environment health check |

## Integration with Replit

### For You (User)
- Use simple `python workflow.py <command>` for all operations
- No need to remember complex script paths
- Clear visual feedback in console
- One command covers entire workflows

### For AI Assistants
- Consistent command interface across all operations
- Easy to execute and verify results
- Built-in error handling and status reporting
- Simplified debugging and development

## Current Environment Status

Your development environment is currently:
- ✅ Running on port 5000
- ✅ 17 Arabic feedback records in database
- ✅ All channels active (WhatsApp, email, mobile app, website)
- ✅ Health checks passing

## Quick Start Examples

```bash
# Check everything
python workflow.py status

# Add more test data
python workflow.py seed

# Deploy to staging for testing
python workflow.py staging

# Run full test suite
python workflow.py test
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplified Access** - One command interface for all operations
2. **Replit Friendly** - Works within Replit's constraints
3. **Error Handling** - Built-in validation and error reporting
4. **Visual Feedback** - Clear console output with status indicators
5. **Environment Safety** - Proper isolation between dev/staging/production

This system provides the same functionality as dedicated Replit workflow buttons but through a unified command interface that's accessible to both users and AI assistants.
