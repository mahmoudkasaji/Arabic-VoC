Excellent feedback from Replit! Let me address each question to ensure we build this right:
Answers to Implementation Questions:
1. Sentiment Drivers Specificity
Capture EXACT phrases - this is crucial for actionability:
python# GOOD - Exact phrases:
"sentiment_drivers": [
    "waited 3 hours for response",
    "charged twice on my bill", 
    "app crashed 4 times today",
    "never received my order"
]

# BAD - Interpretive:
"sentiment_drivers": [
    "excessive wait time",
    "billing issues",
    "technical problems",
    "delivery failure"
]
Why? Exact phrases help:

Train support teams on specific trigger words
Identify patterns across customers
Measure improvement precisely ("3 hours" â†’ "30 minutes")
Build automated responses for common issues

2. Churn Risk Calculation
For the MVP, base it purely on sentiment language, but structure it to add context later:
python# MVP Version - Language only:
def calculate_churn_risk(text, csat_prediction):
    high_risk_phrases = ["cancel", "never again", "switching to", "last chance", "unacceptable"]
    medium_risk_phrases = ["disappointed", "frustrated", "considering options", "not happy"]
    
    if csat_prediction <= 2 and any(phrase in text.lower() for phrase in high_risk_phrases):
        return "high"
    elif csat_prediction <= 3:
        return "medium"
    else:
        return "low"

# Future version would add:
# - customer_lifetime_value
# - months_as_customer  
# - previous_tickets
# - product_tier
3. Actionable vs Non-Actionable
Actionable = Specific issue + Clear ownership + Fixable
python# ACTIONABLE feedback has:
# 1. Specific issue identified
# 2. Clear department/team ownership
# 3. Fixable within reasonable effort

actionable_examples = {
    "actionable": True,
    "examples": [
        "Checkout button returns 404 error",  # Specific tech issue
        "Invoice #12345 charged twice",       # Specific billing issue
        "Support agent John was rude",        # Specific person/training issue
        "Shipping took 10 days not 2"        # Specific SLA violation
    ]
}

non_actionable_examples = {
    "actionable": False,
    "examples": [
        "Your service sucks",           # Too vague
        "Not happy",                    # No specific issue
        "Everything is terrible",       # No clear ownership
        "Just fix it"                   # No identifiable problem
    ]
}
Enhanced Prompt with These Clarifications:
pythonSENTIMENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Analyze this customer feedback for business impact:

Text: {text}

Rate sentiment on CSAT scale (1-5):
1 = Very Dissatisfied (will churn)
2 = Dissatisfied (at risk)  
3 = Neutral (passive)
4 = Satisfied (stable)
5 = Very Satisfied (promoter)

Extract EXACT phrases from the text, not interpretations.

Return JSON:
{
    "csat_prediction": 1-5,
    "churn_risk": "high/medium/low",
    "churn_indicators": ["exact phrases suggesting churn like 'cancel' or 'switching to'"],
    "sentiment_drivers": ["exact customer phrases - e.g. 'waited 3 hours' not 'long wait'"],
    "actionable": true/false,
    "actionable_reason": "why this is/isn't actionable",
    "requires_followup": true/false,
    "urgency": "immediate/high/medium/low"
}

Actionable = Has specific issue + clear owner + fixable
Requires followup = Customer expects response OR issue is critical
"""
This approach gives ops teams exactly what they need: WHO needs to fix WHAT by WHEN.
