Great questions from Replit! Let me clarify the vision for each agent to ensure we build exactly what will deliver business value:
Answers to Replit's Questions:
1. SentimentImpactAgent Output
Yes, it should output BOTH, but with a clear relationship:
python{
    "sentiment_score": -0.8,  # Raw emotion (-1 to 1)
    "csat_prediction": 2,     # Business metric (1-5)
    "confidence": 0.85,       # How sure we are
    "mapping_rationale": "Strong negative language ('terrible', 'never again') typically correlates with CSAT 1-2"
}
The key insight: sentiment is the INPUT, CSAT prediction is the BUSINESS OUTPUT. This agent learns the correlation between emotional language and actual satisfaction scores.
2. DriverAnalysisAgent Focus
EXACTLY! It should identify specific CX drivers, not generic topics:
Good Drivers (Specific):

"3-day response time"
"billing error - double charge"
"app crashes during checkout"
"shipping delay - 7 days late"

Bad Drivers (Generic):

"customer service"
"product issues"
"delivery problems"

The agent should extract the SPECIFIC issue that drove satisfaction up or down.
3. BusinessImpactAgent KPIs
Beyond CSAT, it should correlate to:
Revenue Metrics:

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) impact
Churn risk percentage
Upsell/cross-sell probability
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) at risk

Operational Metrics:

Support ticket volume prediction
Average Handle Time (AHT) impact
Escalation probability
Cost to serve increase

Brand Metrics:

Net Promoter Score (NPS) impact
Online review likelihood (1-5 star prediction)
Word-of-mouth impact (viral coefficient)
Brand sentiment shift

Example Output:
python{
    "kpi_impacts": {
        "csat_change": -0.3,
        "nps_impact": -8,
        "churn_risk_increase": 0.15,  # 15% higher churn risk
        "mrr_at_risk": 2500,          # This customer's value
        "support_hours_needed": 2.5,   # To resolve
        "escalation_probability": 0.7,
        "review_risk": {
            "likelihood": 0.8,
            "predicted_rating": 2
        }
    },
    "resolution_roi": {
        "cost_to_fix": 125,    # Support time + credits
        "value_preserved": 2500, # MRR saved
        "roi_ratio": 20.0      # 20:1 return on fixing
    }
}
Next Implementation Focus:
The architecture should flow like this:
Raw Feedback → SentimentImpactAgent → "This customer is angry (CSAT: 2)"
     ↓
DriverAnalysisAgent → "Because: billing charged twice + 3-day wait"
     ↓
BusinessImpactAgent → "Impact: $2,500 MRR at risk, 70% churn probability"
     ↓
Dashboard → "Fix billing bug: Save $312K/month across affected customers"
This gives executives a clear path from feedback to financial impact, making the platform's ROI undeniable.
Ready for the refined prompts that implement this vision!
