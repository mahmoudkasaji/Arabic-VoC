1. Journey Stage Granularity
Yes, let's break down "support" for more actionable insights:
pythonJOURNEY_STAGES = {
    "awareness": ["research", "discovery", "comparison"],
    "purchase": ["evaluation", "checkout", "payment"],
    "onboarding": ["account_setup", "first_use", "initial_training"],
    "usage": ["daily_use", "feature_adoption", "value_realization"],
    "support": [
        "first_contact",      # Initial reach out
        "diagnosis",          # Problem identification  
        "resolution_attempt", # First fix attempt
        "escalation",        # Escalated to higher tier
        "resolution",        # Problem solved
        "follow_up"          # Post-resolution check
    ],
    "renewal": ["renewal_notice", "negotiation", "payment", "expansion"]
}
This granularity helps because:

"first_contact" issues → improve self-service/FAQs
"escalation" issues → better L1 training needed
"resolution" issues → fix root causes

2. Quantifiable Impact
Include BOTH numeric and countable events:
pythonQUANTIFIABLE_IMPACT_EXAMPLES = {
    "numeric": [
        "$50 overcharge",
        "7 day delay",
        "45 minute wait",
        "30% price increase"
    ],
    "countable": [
        "3 failed login attempts",
        "5 calls to resolve",
        "4 different agents",
        "2 weeks without response"
    ],
    "measurable_effort": [
        "spent 2 hours trying",
        "submitted 3 tickets",
        "emailed 4 times",
        "restarted 10 times"
    ]
}
Enhanced DriverAnalysisAgent Prompt:
pythonDRIVER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Extract specific CX drivers from this feedback:

Text: {text}

Identify the PRIMARY issue impacting satisfaction:

Categories:
- Service failures (response time, resolution quality, agent competence)
- Product issues (bugs, missing features, performance, reliability)
- Process friction (billing errors, complex procedures, system failures)
- Value perception (pricing concerns, competitor comparison, ROI questions)

Journey Stages:
- Awareness: research, discovery, comparison
- Purchase: evaluation, checkout, payment
- Onboarding: setup, first_use, training
- Usage: daily_use, feature_adoption
- Support: first_contact, diagnosis, resolution_attempt, escalation, resolution, follow_up
- Renewal: renewal_notice, negotiation, expansion

Return JSON:
{
    "primary_driver": "category from above",
    "specific_issue": "exact problem in customer's words",
    "impact_severity": "critical/high/medium/low",
    "affected_journey_stage": "specific stage from above",
    "quantifiable_impact": "numeric ($X, Y days) or countable (Z attempts/calls/hours)",
    "friction_points": ["list of specific obstacles customer faced"],
    "root_cause_hint": "potential underlying issue"
}

Severity Guide:
- Critical: Service unusable, money lost, data compromised
- High: Major workflow blocked, significant delays
- Medium: Workaround exists but painful
- Low: Minor annoyance, cosmetic issue
"""
This enhanced version:

Provides more granular journey stages
Clarifies what makes something "quantifiable"
Adds friction points to identify process improvements
Includes root cause hints for preventive action
