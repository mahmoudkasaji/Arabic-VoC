```python
from utils.specialized_orchestrator import VoCAnalysisCommittee

committee = VoCAnalysisCommittee()
result = await committee.analyze_feedback_enhanced(
    text="الخدمة ممتازة والفريق محترم جداً",
    use_consensus=True
)

print(f"Consensus Score: {result['consensus_score']}")
print(f"Cultural Confidence: {result['cultural_confidence']}")
```
